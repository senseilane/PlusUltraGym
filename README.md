# PlusUltraGym
For this project I created a gym membership application that connected to an sql database.

When the application first loads the user sees the start page. It has four buttons.
1. Member Sign In
2. New Member
3. Lookup Members
4. Logout

The member sign in page allows you to put in a membership number and retrieves the name of that member. The New member button allows the user to input new information such as payment information and personal information. The Lookup Members button take the user to a page with the database displayed in a grid so the user can search the database for an existing member that way. The Logout button exits the application.
